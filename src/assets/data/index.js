After I developed different components in React to create buttons with effects such as hover. I Implemented a map to create a content structure on the cards for each case. In the services section I used a library of SVG icons to which I gave them a transition and opacity effect. The contact page links to the different social networks of the brand. Through a clean website with minimal style. I highlighted the primary color of its logo in vector shapes and fundamental elements, in this way it achieved the main objective.",
